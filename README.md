# SQLProject--LawFirmFeedback
 
This project was part of Code First Girls Introduction to Data and SQL course (October-November 2020). I created a SQL database project from scratch based on the idea of a law firm seeknig to analyse data on client feedback. 

This project includes all of the 'advanced options', for example an event, trigger, stored procedure and a view using at least 3 base tables.
